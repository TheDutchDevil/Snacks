                <p>
                    A while ago a good friend and I were discussing a statement made 
                    by her mom: She stated that someone who likes savoury snacks prefers 
                    sex, and that someone who likes sweet snacks prefers cuddling. Her mom stated that 
                    she thought about it for a bit, and came to the conclusion that it must 
                    be true.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We heard this, discussed about it for a while, and couldn't really refute it off
                    the cuff. So we made a survey, used r/SampleSize to get some respondents
                    and did the science to determine if snack preference predicts whether 
                    someone likes cuddling or sex more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below we'll show the survey, the raw results, and show some interesting charts 
                    that we made from the data. Oh, and of cours we do the science to determine whether
                    snack preference predicts sex vs. cuddling. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    So what is this about? It's about <b>SNAAAAAACKS:</b>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The survey</h2>

                <p>
                    For the survery we basically asked questions in three different categories. We 
                    first asked for some demographic information, then we moved on the the 18+ questions,
                    and finally we concluded by asking whether people prefer sweet snacks or savoury snacks. 
                    The questions are listed below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Demographic questions:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Gender? (male, female, other) </em><br/>
                                
                                We worded this as sex, but it should've been gender.</li>
                            <li><em>Age? </em></li>
                            <li><em>Education level? </em><br/>
                                We provided 5 levels, no education, high school, bachelor, masters and PhD. This 
                                matches the Dutch system, but from what we gathered from the comments this doesn't match the US system.
                                However, it appeared that people picked the closest matching option.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>Are your partnered? (yes/no/it's complicated)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>18+ Questions:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Do you prefer sex or cuddling? (sex, cuddling)</em></li>
                            <li><em>How many sexual partners have you had in the past year?</em></li>
                            <li><em>Would you consider yourself sexually adventurous? (yes, no, maybe)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Snacks:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Do you prefer sweet or savoury snacks? (sweet, savoury)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In total we had around <em>2,150</em> responses to the survey, which is an absolutely 
                    insane amount! So thanks r/SampleSize! Below is all of the raw data, represented as 
                    either histograms or pie charts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some interesting things here: Gender division of male vs. female was about 50/50.
                    So as it turns out not all Reddit readers are male, in fact, half of them are female. 
                    Secondly we have a 33/33/33 split when it comes
                    to the question <em>do you consider yourself to be sexually adventurous or not?</em>
                    Which we also didn't really expect to be honest.

                <p>
                    Nothing too shocking when it comes to ages, although we have to say that the mean 
                    age is a bit higher than expected. However, this could just be a sampling bias, as 
                    r/SampleSize probably has a higher average age than say r/Teenagers.

                <p>
                    First of all, we applied some filtering when it comes to the data. For instance,
                    there were some people who filled out they had 600+ sexual partners in the last year.
                    While some people do get around, 2 unique sexual partners per day for a whole year is 
                    quite a significant number. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Snacks and Sex</h2>

                <p>
                    So this is the question we're all interested in. Does snack preference predict whether
                    someone prefers sex over cuddling? Let's start by visualizing it:
                </p>

                <div class="figure-inline">
                        <img src="plots/gbar-snacks-sex.png" class="center-block" style="max-width: 100%;">
                        <p class="small"><b>Figure 4: </b> Grouped bar chart showing cuddling vs sex over snack
                            preference.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Based on the above plot you could say it is looking pretty bad for supporters of this 
                    hypothesis. However, this is more that we can do to analyze this: For instance, we can do 
                    a paired t-test to see if snack and sex preferences are from the same population. If this is 
                    the case the hypothesis is supported. As we expect that savoury lines up with sex, and sweet with 
                    cuddling. However, the p-value of a Wilcoxon signed rank test is very, very small. Indicating that
                    these values do not match up. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, we also built a linear model where we try to predict sex preferences based on all 
                    features collected in the survey. In this model we see that there is no signifcance to the 
                    snacks feature, therefore indicating that it has no real predictive power. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we combine these three facts it doesn't take us long to arrive at the conclusion that there
                    is <b>no link whatsoever</b> between snack preferences and sex preferences. 
                </p>  

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">HEB NOG EEN TITEL NODIG</h2>        

                <div class="figure-inline">
                        <img src="plots/boxplot-sex-snack-ages.png" class="center-block" style="max-width: 100%;">
                        <p class="small"><b>Figure 5: </b> Boxplots which show the ages of the four different groups.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    However, with the data that we have there is more we can analyze, for instance, what are the 
                    ages for the snacks x sex groups? As can be observed in Figure 5 there is not a shockingly large
                    difference in these age distributions. 
                </p>      

                <div class="figure-inline">
                        <img src="plots/gbar-adv-sex.png" class="center-block" style="max-width: 100%;">

                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Now that we know that snack preference does not predict sex preference we can check if there might
                    be other features in the data that do predict this. For instance Figure 6 shows sex vs. cuddling
                    distributed over the possible answers for 'Do you consider yourself to be sexually adventurous?'. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    We can also do the same for relationship status, where Figure 7 shows us that single people apparently 
                    prefer (or maybe miss?) cuddling. And of course a shout-out to all those poor souls who submitted 
                    'It's complicated' for their relationship status.

                <p>
                    We don't just have to look at snacks, for instance, using the gender information we have 
                    we can also plot sex preference against gender. Figure 8 shows us that women tend to prefer
                    cuddling more, while for men the split is almost 50/50. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When it comes to gender and relations we can observe from Figure 9 that females on Redit more 
                    often tend to have a partner than males on Reddit. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Figure 10 shows us that there are pretty insignificant age difference between different groups if we
                    look at relationship status and gener. However, males in relationship might be a tiny bit younger on 
                    average.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, (and this is the last of plots, I promise!), Figure 11 shows how sex preference is distributed over
                    education levels. Nothing too special here, there appears to be no difference in whether someone prefers
                    sex or cuddling for different education levels. 
                </p>         

                <div class="figure-inline">

                <p>
                    In Figure 12 we see that ration between single and partnered slowly shifts as the education level increases.
                    Whether this just is because age also increases, or whether education level actually factors in something
                    that will have to be followed up upon.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the last plot of the series we look at Figure 13 and see that apparently post-bachelor students go 
                    through a phase where they consider themselves to be more sexually adventurour than other groups. However,
                    this is relatively short-lived as they settle down again after their masters or PhD.

                    So, the most important takeway point here is that there is <b>no relation</b> between snacks and 
                    sexual preference(A real shocker, I know!). Additionally, it is interesting to see how the 
                    population of reddit is divided, and especially how sexual preferences is distributed over 
                    relationship status and gender.  Also, we might have a problem taking things too seriously,
                    as this has been a huge waste of time. But oh well.

                    Finally a big thank you to r/SampleSize for providing us with so many great datapoints! To analyze
                    the data we've used Jupyter Notebooks, and this site is being hosted with Github pages, using a 
                    Bootstrap template that can be found in the footer. If you're interested in the code check out 
                    the GitHub project here.
